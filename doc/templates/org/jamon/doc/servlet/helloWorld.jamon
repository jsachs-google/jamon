<span class="concept">Hello World</span>
In this section we will create a very simple servlet that displays
a page generated using Jamon.  To this end we will present
<ul>
  <li>the complete code for a servlet,</li>
  <li>a (Jamon) template,</li>
  <li>a deployment descriptor (i.e., the <code>web.xml</code> file), and</li>
  <li>an Ant script to build the project.</li>
</ul>

In addition the exact directory layout will be specified, but of
course in your own projects you are free to use your own layout.  Note
that

<ul>
<%def root>/home/alice/tutorial</%def>
  <li>
    All paths are relative to a base directory for the tutorial.  For
    example, if you choose the base directory to be <code><& root
    &></code>, then a reference to a directory
    <code>templates/foo/bar</code> means <code><& root
    &>/templates/foo/bar</code>.  A reference to a file
    <code>web.xml</code> means <code><& root &>/web.xml</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you wish to avoid typing in the examples in this section all
      the source code is available in a <a href="foobar.zip">zipfile</a>.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>

In directory <code class="file">templates/foo/bar</code> create a file called
<a class="file" href="templates/foo/bar/HelloTemplate.jamon">HelloTemplate.jamon</a> (you should <em>save</em>
this file since your browser may not display it correctly) containing:

<& ../_TemplateInclude: "/sample/servlet/templates/HelloTemplate" &>

In directory <code class="file">src/foo/bar</code> create
a file <a href="src/foo/bar/HelloServlet.java">HelloServlet.java</a> containing:

<& ../_JavaInclude: "/sample/servlet/src/HelloServlet" &>

Create the following deployment descriptor by placing the following in a file
called <a href="web.xml">web.xml</a>:

<& ../_FileInclude; path = "/sample/servlet/web.xml"; cssClass = "webxml" &>

Create an Ant script by placing the following in a file called
<a href="build.xml">build.xml</a>:

<& ../_FileInclude; path = "/sample/servlet/build.xml"; cssClass = "ant" &>

In order to run this script you need to tell Ant where to find the Jamon libraries
and the servlet APIs.  For example, say the jamon JAR file is in
<code>/usr/share/java/jamon.jar</code> and the servlet APIs are in
<code>/somewhere/else/servlet.jar</code>, then you would execute it by typing:

<pre class="tty">% ant -Djava.lib.jamon=/usr/share/java/jamon.jar \
     -Djava.lib.servlet=/somewhere/else/servlet.jar</pre>

This will translate the Jamon source into Java, compile them and the servlet, and
place it all into a WAR file called <code>foobar.war</code>.
(You can download a copy of the <a href="foobar.war">WAR file</a> if you like.)
Place the WAR file where your servlet container expects to find web applications
and start the container.
Assuming you deployed the above servlet into
a context called "foobar" and that the container listens for HTTP requests on port 8080,
you should receive a worldly greeting by pointing a browser to
<a href="http://localhost:8080/foobar/hello">http://localhost:8080/foobar/hello</a>.
