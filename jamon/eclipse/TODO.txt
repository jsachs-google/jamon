Allow setting breakpoints in templates
  - maybe do side-by-side debugging of template and corresponding source

Allow user-specified template folder(s) and generated source folder(s)

Primitive Jamon editor and file type

Possibly hide / alternate display of generated source folder

"Trampoline" compilation errors in generated templates to have markers
indicate template source problem. Do this by registering a "post" builder
which traverses markers on generated sources and "moves" them to the templates.
Will need a map from generated source line numbers to template line numbers.

New Jamon project wizard

Add interfaces so that can have Eclipse use Jamon generation classes
from a project (so can develop Jamon in Eclipse)
