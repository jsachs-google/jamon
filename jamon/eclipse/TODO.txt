Allow setting breakpoints in templates
  - maybe do side-by-side debugging of template and corresponding source

Allow user-specified template folder(s) and generated source folder(s)

Primitive Jamon editor and file type

Possibly hide / alternate display of generated source folder

"Trampoline" compilation errors in generated templates to have markers
indicate template source problem. Do this by registering a "post" builder
which traverses markers on generated sources and "moves" them to the templates.
Will need a map from generated source line numbers to template line numbers.

New Jamon project wizard

Add interfaces so that can have Eclipse use Jamon generation classes
from a project (so can develop Jamon in Eclipse)

Provide a view similar to the Package Explorer for templates, geared towards
hiding empty parent packages as the PE does.  Ideally, we could extended the 
PE itself, but there appear to be no extension points available.  Perhaps we 
could trick it by claiming that the template directory was a source directory, 
but this probably would have some unintended consequences.
