* Update docs to reflect release.
* Run svn up to get latest version number set
* For each maven module being released:
** Update all SNAPSHOT versions to the latest released version.
** Run (in zsh):
  read -s password; mvn -Dusername=yourSourceForgeUserNameHere -Dpassword=$password release:prepare; unset password
** Since maven fails to understand usernames in scpexe urls, ensure ~/.ssh/config contains:
  Host maven.jamon.org
  User jamon
** Run mvn release:perform
* If necessary, build jamonStdLib
* generate new site docs
** Update version of docs pom to current date.
** mvn install
** mvn deploy:site
* Update versions in jamon-dist, run jamon-package.
* Upload dist files to sourceforge:
** Ftp jamon-X.Y.Z{,-src}.{tgz,zip} and jamon-anttask-X.Y.Z.jar
    to upload.sf.net, in the incoming directory
** From the project home page, go to Admin->File Releases
** Click on "Add release" next to package jamon
** Create release jamon-X.Y.Z
** Copy notes from Changes.html in docs
** Select uploaded files
** Each file needs to be edited and submitted separately (sigh)
** Click on the send release notice

TODO: Tycho

* Copy jamon-X.Y.Z.jar to corePlugin
* Update version numbers for corePlugin, uiPlugin and jamonFeature
* Build the plugin in eclipse by opening site.xml in updateSite and clicking on "Build All"
* In updateSite, run "ant push"
* In update site, run "ant localSite".  Upload the resulting jamon-updateSite-X.Y.Z.Q.zip file
   to SourceForge under the jamon-eclipse-plugin package, as described above.
* svn copy https://jamon.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jamon/trunk/eclipse \
     https://jamon.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jamon/tags/JAMON-ECLIPSE-X_Y_Z_0-RELEASE
  (note - if releasing off of a branch, copy from there!)
* Build and release maven code
** Get jamon-x.y.z.jar and jamon-anttask-x.y.z.jar from SF
** Deploy both to maven.jamon.org via
    mvn -s ~/.m2jamon/settings.xml -DgroupId=org.jamon -DartifactId=jamon \
     -Dversion=2.2.1 -Dfile=jamon-2.2.1.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=jamon \
     -Durl=scpexe://jamon@maven.jamon.org/home/jamon/maven2 deploy:deploy-file
    mvn -s ~/.m2jamon/settings.xml -DgroupId=org.jamon -DartifactId=jamon-anttask \
     -Dversion=2.2.1 -Dfile=jamon-anttask-2.2.1.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=jamon \
     -Durl=scpexe://jamon@maven.jamon.org/home/jamon/maven2 deploy:deploy-file
  (the '-s ~/.m2jamon/settings.xml indicates an alternate local maven repo
   which is useful for hygiene)
** Edit mvn2-plugin/pom.xml updating the dependency versions and the pom version
** Commit to the tag branch (this yuckiness goes away with repo restructuring)
** Commit a similar pom.xml change to trunk, just adding '-SNAPSHOT' to pom version
* Push docs to site (FIXME - HOW?  maybe mvn deploy?)
* Email release mailing list.
