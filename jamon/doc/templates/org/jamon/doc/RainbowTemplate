    <h1>Servlets with Jamon</h1>
    The goal of this document is to guide the reader through the process of developing and
    deploying servlets that use Jamon to generate the HTML (i.e., for their <em>view</em>,
    in MVC parlance).  Thus the servlets will be kept simple but nevertheless representative
    of a typical development environment.

      <li><& helloWorld &></li>

      <li><& parametersAndInput &></li>

      <li><& standardLibrary &></li>

        This entire document was generated with the aid of Jamon.  All the HTML escaping
        was automatically generated by Jamon, the highlightinh of changes from snippet to
        snippet.  It even generated source files for inclusion in the WAR file for download.
        Which means that part of the process of generating this ducmentation checked that
        the examples at least compiled.  In particular this means that Jamon is being used
        to autogenerate Jamon sources!
