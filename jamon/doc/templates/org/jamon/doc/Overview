<h2>Overview</h2>

To make use of Jamon:

<ul>

  <li>Create your templates.<li>

  <li>
    Run the template processor on them, either via the command line or
    the <a href="BuildingProjects.html">Jamon Ant task</a>.
    This generates Java source files corresponding to the templates.
  </li>

  <li>
    In your "regular" Java source files, reference templates like any
    other class. Instantiate a template like any other class
    (supplying a <code>TemplateManager</code> to the constructor).
  </li>

  <li>Include generated files in your build process.</li>

  <li>
    At runtime, changes made to the template sources are automatically
    reflected in the running application. This is accomplished by
    regeneration and recompilation of the sources corresponding to
    your templates. This default behavior can be turned off for
    production deployment.
  </li>

</ul>
