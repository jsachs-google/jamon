<span class="concept">Hello World</span>
Create a file called <span class="file">HelloTemplate</span> in a directory 
<span class="file">foo/bar</span>.

<pre class="template"><&| /org/jamon/escape/Html &><& hello &></&></pre>

Inside your code tree, in directory <span class="file">foo/bar</span> create
a file <span class="file">HelloServlet</span> containing:

<pre class="code"><& HelloServletTemplate &></pre>

Create the following deployment descriptor by placing the following in a file
called <span class="file">web.xml</span>:

<pre class="webxml"><&| /org/jamon/escape/Html &><& webxml &></&></pre>

The following Ant script will compile the Java and Jamon sources:

<pre class="ant"><&| /org/jamon/escape/Html &><& buildxml &></&></pre>

Finally you can compile the sources

<pre class="tty">% ant build</pre>

and start the servlet container.  Assuming you deployed the above servlet into
a context called "foobar" and that the container listens for HTTP requests on port 8080,
you should receive a worldly greeting by pointing a browser to 
<a href="http://localhost:8080/foobar/hello">http://localhost:8080/foobar/hello</a>.
