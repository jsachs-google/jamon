Allow setting breakpoints in templates
  - maybe do side-by-side debugging of template and corresponding source

Allow user-specified template folder(s) and generated source folder(s)

Possibly hide / alternate display of generated source folder

New Jamon project wizard

Add interfaces so that can have Eclipse use Jamon generation classes
from a project (so can develop Jamon in Eclipse)

Provide a view similar to the Package Explorer for templates, geared towards
hiding empty parent packages as the PE does.  Ideally, we could extended the
PE itself, but there appear to be no extension points available.  Perhaps we
could trick it by claiming that the template directory was a source directory,
but this probably would have some unintended consequences.
